# Reinforcement Learning

### Purpose:

Solve the cartpole environment from the OpenAI Gym with a proof of concept script, before building generalisable classes to apply to more complicated environments.


### Requirements:

This project uses:

* The amdgpu driver
* Tensorflow, keras, and plaidML; plaidML will require a pip install and not a conda install
* Anaconda
* The OpenAI Gym (install is not via a standard `conda install`, but instead with `conda install -c conda-forge gym`.
* A few other python packages (a `requirements.txt` is provided for replicating my environment)
